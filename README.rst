===================
PyLibTiff V0.1.0
===================

This Git repository contains a Python wrapper for the libtiff library.

It provides the following features:

* read and write TIFF images using the libtiff v4 reference implementation
* read and write scientific grade TIFF images
* support gray8, gray16, rgb8, rgb16 image formats
* interleaved and planar format for RGB composite format
* LZW compression
* Numpy array

The wrapper is generated by Swig and built using CMake.

The source code should be considered as a concrete example to read and write TIFF images using the
libtiff, but not as a clean Python module. A nice enhancement would be to use CFFI instead of Swig
and build using a standard *setup.py*. (I don't plan to do it soon.)

This Python module was written as an alternative to the unmaintained PIL library that provides a
partial TIFF implementation written in Python. In opposite this implementation could gives access to
the whole TIFF format.

Source Repository
-----------------

The PyLibTiff project is hosted at github
http://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/PyLibTiff

Requirements
------------

* libtiff (devel package)
* Python 2.7 (devel package)
* Numpy
* CMake
* Swig
* GCC

Building & Installing
---------------------

Run the following commands in a terminal::

  git clone git@github.com:FabriceSalvaire/PyLibTiff.git
  mkdir PyLibTiff-build
  cd PyLibTiff-build
  ccmake PyLibTiff

This procedure was tested on Fedora 18 x64, take care to compile against Python 2.7 library and not
Python 3.

Running Examples
----------------

See Python files in the *examples* directory.
